# Tic Tac Toe Game

## 📜 Project Description

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a square in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X and O). The objective is to be the first to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This implementation provides an interactive console interface for players to engage in the game. Additionally, it includes features for saving and loading game states, allowing players to pause and resume their games at any time.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- **Two-Player Mode**: Players can take turns to play against each other.
- **Game State Saving**: Players can save the current state of the game to a file (`game_state.txt`).
- **Game State Loading**: Players can load a previously saved game state from the file.
- **Input Validation**: The game checks for valid moves and ensures players cannot overwrite existing moves.
- **Win and Draw Detection**: The game automatically checks for win conditions and draws after each move.
- **User -Friendly Interface**: The game provides clear instructions and feedback to players throughout the game.
